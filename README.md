Tools and conventions for authoring and publishing boilerplates that can be generated by any build system or generator.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save boilerplate
```

Welcome to boilerplate! Here you'll find both the tools and conventions for creating project boilerplates.

**What does this do?**

1. Makes it easy to create and publish new projects from boilerplates that have reusable [scaffolds][scaffold], templates, styles, themes, data etc.
2. To uncouple these "non-moving-parts" from any particular build system or generator, so we can easily generate new projects by simply passing the boilerplate config object to your build system or project generator of choice!

**Example**

In the following example, we define:

* **scaffolds** for our marketing and developer sites
* **targets** inside each scaffold (`site` and `blog`)
* **files** configurations inside each "site" and "blog" target

The configuration is similar to how [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks would be defined.

```js
var boilerplate = require('boilerplate');

boilerplate({
  marketing: {
    site: {
      src: 'templates/mktg/*.hbs',
      dest: 'site/'
    },
    blog: {
      src: 'content/blog/*.md',
      dest: 'site/blog/'
    }
  },
  developer: {
    site: {
      src: 'templates/dev/*.hbs',
      dest: 'site/developer'
    },
    blog: {
      src: 'content/dev/blog/*.md',
      dest: 'site/developer/blog/'
    }
  }
});
```

The `Boilerplate` library "expands" this configuration into a normalized object that can easily be passed to [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble), [metalsmith](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith), or even [yeoman](http://yeoman.io), for scaffolding out various parts of a blog, website, web application or whatever you think a boilerplate might be useful for!

## html5-boilerplate example

Just to show how easy it is to convert an existing project into a `Boilerplate` project using the most popular boilerplate of them all: [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).

_(Get hands-on with the [h5bp recipe](./recipes/h5bp))_

**Install h5bp**

First, install `boilerplate` and [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate):

```sh
$ npm i boilerplate && git clone https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate.git vendor/h5bp
```

**Define the boilerplate**

The following examples returns a normalized configuration object for every file in the [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) project, organized exactly the way the project itself is organized.

```js
var Boilerplate = require('boilerplate');
var h5bp = new Boilerplate({
  options: {
    cwd: 'vendor/h5bp/dist'
  },
  root: {src: ['{.*,*.*}'],   dest: 'src/'},
  css:  {src: ['css/*.css'],  dest: 'src/'},
  doc:  {src: ['doc/*.md'],   dest: 'src/'},
  js:   {src: ['js/**/*.js'], dest: 'src/'}
});
console.log(h5bp);
```

Results in the following object:

```js
{
  options: {
    cwd: 'vendor/h5bp/dist'
  },
  config: {},
  targets: {
    root: {
      options: {
        cwd: 'vendor/h5bp/dist'
      },
      files: [

## About

**What is a boilerplate?**

A boilerplate is a project with generic, reusable code, files or content that is intended to be used as a starting point for creating new projects.

**What does this project provide?**

* [opinionated conventions](./docs/terminology.md) for defining and organizing project boilerplates
* [API](#api) for actually creating boilerplates
* [documentation](./docs/getting-started.md) and [guide](./docs/guide.md) to help you get started with [authoring](docs/authoring.md) your own boilerplates
* [website](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/boilerplate) for discovering boilerplates created by the community

**What does this NOT provide?**

Workflows and tools for actually generating new projects from a boilerplate. This is a job much better suited for build systems like [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli), and [yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

If you publish a library that works with Boilerplate, please [let us know about it](https://github.com/boilerplates/boilerplates/issues/new?title=boilerplate-%5Bname%20here%5D&body=I%20created%20a%20new%20boilerplate%3A%0A%0A*%20homepage%3A%20%5Bproject%20url%5D%20%0A*%20description%3A%20%5Bboilerplate%20description%5D)!

### Comparison table

Many definitions exist for the terms "boilerplate", "scaffold" and "template". The following definitions describe these concepts as it relates to this project.

| **type** | **description** | 
| --- | --- |
| [template](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) | Resuable file, code or content which contains "placeholder" values that will eventually be replaced with real values by a rendering (template) engine |
| [scaffold](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/scaffold) | Consists of one or more templates or source files and serves as a "temporary support structure" that may be used to initialize a new project, or to provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project. |
| boilerplate | Boilerplates consist of all of the necessary files required to initialize a complete project. |
